# VIGIL Progress Log

Running status doc, updated as we go. See `BUILD_PLAN.md` for the original day-by-day
plan and `GATE_DECISION.md` for the scope decision. This file is the source of truth
for "what's actually verified working" vs. "what's built but untested."

## 2026-08-28 (Fri evening) — Status check + gate decision

**Context:** Original plan called for a Day-7 gate on Aug 27. That didn't happen as a
discrete step — most of the pipeline was built in one session on Aug 21 (single commit
`dd645fc Build VIGIL local triage foundation`) and then untouched until tonight. With
3 days left to the Aug 31 5pm PDT / 8pm ET deadline, tonight *is* the gate, done late.

**Verified working tonight** (fresh `uv sync` + `pytest` + `ruff` + demo run, in a clean
environment, not the possibly-stale local `.venv`):
- All 14 tests pass, `ruff check` clean.
- `make demo` (`pipeline.run_batch --demo`) runs end-to-end on the bundled fixture:
  ingest → embed (TF-IDF fallback) → HDBSCAN cluster → frozen-config risk scoring →
  citation-stamped brief. Deterministic, no credentials needed, no GCP calls.
- Code exists for the fuller design: `agents/critic.py` (citation gate),
  `agents/definitions.py` (ADK graph, `gemini-3.7-flash` for agents, `gemini-embedding-2`
  for batch), `pipeline/store.py` (Firestore), `ui/streamlit_app.py`, `eval/guards.py`,
  `eval/holdout_score.py`.

**Not yet verified — these are the real risk items, not feature gaps:**
1. Repo is a local commit only. **No GitHub remote — not public.** Devpost requires a
   public repo URL. Highest-priority blocker.
2. `data/download.py` has never been run. No real ASRS data, no `data/holdout/` lock.
   Everything above was tested against the tiny bundled fixture only.
3. No live Gemini/Vertex call has ever been made. Model IDs (`gemini-3.7-flash`,
   `gemini-embedding-2`) were verified against docs on 2026-08-21 but never exercised.
4. Firestore: code exists (`pipeline/store.py`) but no Firestore **database instance**
   has been created in the GCP project yet (API enabled ≠ database created).
5. No GCP budget alert set (plan says $50).
6. Nothing has been deployed to Cloud Run (`infra/deploy.sh` unrun).
7. No `docs/GATE_DECISION.md` existed before tonight — see that file for the decision
   made now.
8. No video, no Devpost draft.

**Gate decision:** ship the full build, not the cut-down floor. Rationale: the floor
(ingest → cluster → analyst → brief → critic → human gate) and the fuller design
(coordinator fan-out, Firestore idempotency, UI) both already exist as code and pass
their local tests — cutting scope now would mean deleting working code, not saving
time. The actual remaining work is entirely in categories 1–6 above: make it public,
make it real (real data), make it live (real GCP), not "build more." See
`GATE_DECISION.md`.

**Immediate next actions, in order:**
1. Push repo to a public GitHub repo (blocks: needs `git remote add` + push with your
   credentials — I can prep the commands, you run the push, or tell me you've done it).
2. GCP console: create the Firestore database (Native mode) and set the $50 budget
   alert — both still open from earlier tonight.
3. Run `data/download.py` for real data + do the 30-min EDA pass.
4. Set up live credentials (API key or Vertex) and make one real `LlmAgent` call to
   confirm the model IDs still resolve.
5. `infra/deploy.sh` to Cloud Run (batch job + UI service).
6. Re-run the pipeline against real data, live, and capture the evidence (console
   screenshots, logs) needed for the video.
